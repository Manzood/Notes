This will be a list of time complexities for me to look at until I actually learn the underlying mechanisms behind certain operations/data structures,
after which this list will be rendered pretty useless.
Maybe these resources would be useful to someone else later...
Although I originally intended for this to be a list, I might write down a few comments on some of these

1) C++ STL map:
	a) insertion: O(log n) 
	b) deletion: O(log n)
	c) search: O(log n) 

Both maps and sets can be implemented as binary search trees
